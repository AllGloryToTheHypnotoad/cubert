# Cubert

**still in development**

## Issues

- If you get an error about python not finding `scapy.modules.six.move`
then uninstall `scapy` install `six` and reinstall `scapy` ... wtf?

## Run

```bash
sudo cubert
```

## ToDo

- [ ] Define port
- [ ] Set verbose or quiet command line output
- [ ] Auto reload webpage on network update
- [ ] Do a better job on services, I have Apple hosts that are
not showing services, but they have them
- [ ] Setup a systemd service script to launching
- [ ] Get better logging
